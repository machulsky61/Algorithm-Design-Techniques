# Algorithm Design Techniques

## About the Course
This course provides a comprehensive understanding of fundamental concepts crucial for correct and efficient algorithmic problem-solving. It covers specification, design, implementation, and computational complexity of algorithms. Abstract data types are introduced recursively, and techniques for algorithm analysis and design are presented. Practical exercises, laboratory sessions, and projects are included to apply the learned tools and techniques.
